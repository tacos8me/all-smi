//! Prometheus `/metrics` HTTP handler.
//!
//! Renders the merged reader outputs from [`AppState`] through the shared
//! exposition writer in [`crate::api::metrics::render`]. Kept separate from
//! the SSE / snapshot handlers (issue #193) so adding new routes does not
//! force a rebuild of this unchanged hot path.
//!
//! Status-code contract (issue #324): this endpoint answers `200` for its
//! entire lifetime, including the window between the listener binding and
//! the first collection cycle landing. It is deliberately *not* a
//! readiness probe, because turning it into one would break every scraper
//! that already treats a non-200 as a failed target. What changed in #324
//! is that the body is no longer empty in that window: the exposition
//! carries `all_smi_up 0` plus build info until the first cycle completes,
//! then `all_smi_up 1` plus the full metric set. Consumers that need a
//! yes/no gate use `/-/ready` (see [`crate::api::handlers::ready`]).
