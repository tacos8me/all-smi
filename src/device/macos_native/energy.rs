//! Energy Model channel classification and per-channel power
//!
//! The pure half of the IOReport power readings: which `Energy Model` channels
//! feed each rail, and how a channel's cumulative counter and its publication
//! timestamps become watts. Nothing here calls IOReport, so the behavior is
//! tested from recorded inventories and timestamps. The hardware measurements
//! behind these rules are in the `ioreport` module docs.
//!
//! ## Multi-die packages
//!
//! The first multi-die inventory recorded was an Apple M1 Ultra
//! (Mac13,2, macOS 27.0, `tests/fixtures/ioreport/m1_ultra_energy_model.tsv`).
//! Of its 321 channels, only CPU channels carry the `DIE_<n>_` prefix (34:
//! clusters, per-core channels, `_CPM`, and one `DIE_<n>_CPU Energy` per
//! die). Every other block names its die with a suffix: `ANE0_0` and
//! `ANE0_1`, `DRAM0_0` and `DRAM0_1`, and the same for `ISP`, `AVE`, `MSR`,
//! `DCS`, and `AMCC`. The GPU has a single `GPU0_0` (and `GPU SRAM0_0`) next
//! to `GPU Energy`. No package `CPU Energy`, `ANE`, or `DRAM` sits beside the
//! per-die channels, so summing `DIE_<n>_CPU Energy` and the `<block><n>_<m>`
//! channels counts each die exactly once, which the rules below already do.
//!
//! An Apple M5 Ultra (Mac17,15, macOS 27.0,
//! `tests/fixtures/ioreport/m5_ultra_energy_model.tsv`) has the same layout
//! with M5 cluster names: 725 channels, 92 of them `DIE_<n>_` CPU channels
//! ending in one `DIE_<n>_CPU Energy` per die, `ANE0_<m>` and `DRAM0_<m>`,
//! one `GPU0_0` next to `GPU Energy`, and no package channel beside the
//! per-die ones. The same eight channels classify.
//!
//! `DIE_<n>_` handling for GPU, ANE, and DRAM therefore stays as it is: no
//! recorded chip has such a channel, so none classifies. A chip that adds one
//! has to be recorded first, because only its inventory can show whether a
//! package channel sits next to it, and a per-die sum must never be added to
//! a package total.
//!
//! [`sum_rails`] enforces that on every rail where the matching rules could
//! meet both: only the least specific family present in a sample feeds the
//! rail. A sample with the package `CPU Energy` takes the CPU rail from it
//! alone and ignores `DIE_<n>_CPU Energy`. Without `GPU Energy`, the GPU
//! falls back to the `GPU<n>` channels, which on an M5 Max match
//! `GPU Energy`, and to `GPU<n>_<m>` only when the sample has no `GPU<n>`.
//! ANE and DRAM take bare `ANE` / `DRAM` when present, otherwise `ANE<n>` /
//! `DRAM<n>`, and `ANE<n>_<m>` / `DRAM<n>_<m>` only when neither is there. No
//! recorded chip exercises the guard. Besides `GPU Energy`, each recorded
//! inventory has one family per rail (the M5 Max `CPU Energy`, `GPU0`,
//! `ANE0`, and `DRAM0`; the M1 Ultra `DIE_<n>_CPU Energy`, `GPU0_0`,
//! `ANE0_<m>`, and `DRAM0_<m>`), so both read as before. It is for the
//! multi-die chips nobody has recorded yet, such as the M2 Ultra and M3
//! Ultra.
//!
//! [`EnergyTracker`] keys channels by name. The M1 Ultra lists 130 `DTL`
//! names (`ECPUDTL*`, `PCPUDTL*`, `PCPU1DTL*`) twice each, with no prefix to
//! tell the two apart. None of them classifies, which is what keeps the key
//! unambiguous.
