//! IOReport API bindings for macOS
//!
//! This module provides FFI bindings to Apple's private IOReport framework,
//! which is used to collect power and performance metrics on Apple Silicon.
//!
//! ## Channel Groups
//! - `Energy Model`: Power consumption (CPU, GPU, ANE, DRAM)
//! - `CPU Stats`: CPU core performance states and residency
//! - `GPU Stats`: GPU performance states and residency
//!
//! The subscription holds only the channels of these groups that something
//! reads (24 of 383 on an M5 Max); `channel_filter` has the rules and the
//! measured cost.
//!
//! ## Energy Model: exact channel matching
//!
//! The group is a hierarchy, not a list of rails. On an M5 Max (macOS 27) it
//! holds 364 channels: the `CPU Energy` roll-up, the clusters that sum to it
//! (`MCPU0`, `MCPU1`, `PCPU`), per-core channels, `*_SRAM`, 300 `*DTL*`
//! telemetry channels, `GPU0`, `GPU Energy`, and a dozen other blocks (see
//! `tests/fixtures/ioreport/m5_max_energy_model.tsv`). Substring matching on
//! `CPU` summed the roll-up together with everything under it. One loaded
//! batch:
//!
//! | family | channels | watts |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `CPU Energy` (roll-up) | 1 | 36.17 |
//! | `MCPU0`, `MCPU1`, `PCPU` (clusters) | 3 | 36.17 |
//! | `MCPU*DTL*`, `PCPUDTL*` (per-core telemetry) | 300 | 26.01 |
//! | `MCPUx_y` (per-core) | 12 | 5.20 |
//! | `*_SRAM` | 18 | 3.13 |
//! | reported as CPU power | 334 | 106.68 |
//!
//! That is 2.95x the roll-up. `GPU0` (mJ) and `GPU Energy` (nJ) carry the
//! same energy, so matching both counted the GPU twice. Channels are matched
//! by exact name in [`classify_energy_channel`]: `GPU Energy`; names ending in
//! `CPU Energy` (`DIE_<n>_CPU Energy` on multi-die packages); `GPU<n>` or
//! `GPU<n>_<m>` only when a sample has no `GPU Energy`; and the top-level
//! `ANE`/`DRAM` shapes (`ANE`, `ANE0`, `ANE0_1`). Nothing else is summed, and
//! where a package channel and per-die ones could both match, `sum_rails`
//! counts one of them (see the `energy` module docs).
//!
//! An M1 Ultra (Mac13,2, macOS 27) holds 321 channels
//! (`tests/fixtures/ioreport/m1_ultra_energy_model.tsv`) and no package
//! `CPU Energy`: its CPU rail is `DIE_0_CPU Energy` plus `DIE_1_CPU Energy`.
//! Only CPU channels carry the `DIE_<n>_` prefix. The other blocks name the
//! die with a suffix (`ANE0_0`/`ANE0_1`, `DRAM0_0`/`DRAM0_1`), which the
//! top-level shapes already sum per die, so `DIE_<n>_` GPU, ANE, and DRAM
//! names stay unmatched (the decision and the inventory behind it are in the
//! `energy` module docs). Eight channels classify. The other 313 include 260
//! `DTL` channels (130 names, each listed twice), the per-die clusters,
//! `GPU SRAM0_0`, and ten uJ `apciec<n> Energy` and `PCIe Port <n> Energy`
//! channels.
//!
//! `GPU0_0` is the whole GPU, not die 0. Over a common window of about 29 s
//! it read 0.963 (all-smi idle) and 0.938 (four `yes` loads) of
//! `GPU Energy`, and `GPU0_0` plus `GPU SRAM0_0` read 0.996 and 0.967 of it;
//! over each channel's own first-to-last publication window `GPU0_0` read
//! 0.965 and 0.992. The GPU drew 38 to 81 mW in those runs, so a few mW at a
//! window edge moves the ratio by several percent. `GPU Energy` includes the
//! GPU SRAM that `GPU0_0` leaves out, so the `GPU<n>_<m>` fallback, which
//! counts only when a sample has no `GPU Energy`, would read about 3 % low.
//!
//! ## Energy Model: power from publication timestamps
//!
//! The mJ counters do not advance continuously. On an M5 Max (macOS 27) the
//! driver publishes all of them together in batches 2.03 to 2.23 s apart
//! (measured spans 2027.5 to 2228.1 ms); between publications both the value
//! and its timestamp are frozen. Dividing by the poll window misreads at every
//! interval. At 1 s it alternates between 0 W and a whole batch over 1 s
//! (about 2x). Holding the zero ticks is not enough either, because the window
//! stays quantized to the poll grid: a 2.1 s batch spans 2 s or 3 s of polls,
//! so a 1 s poll reads 1.05x or 0.70x, and at the 3 s API default every window
//! holds one or two batches and the reading beats between 0.7x and 1.4x.
//!
//! An M1 Ultra (macOS 27) also publishes its mJ channels together, but twice
//! per ~2.1 s at uneven intervals whose split drifts: 0.75 to 0.91 s
//! alternating with 1.19 to 1.32 s over one 32 s run, and moving from
//! 1.69 + 0.46 s to 0.97 + 1.14 s over another. Setting the split tails
//! aside, every publication came 2.03 to 2.13 s after the one two before it
//! in the idle run and 2.02 to 2.20 s under load. Each publication's energy
//! follows its own span: `DRAM0_0` read 1.75 to 1.83 W over every printed
//! span of the idle run (815 to 1295 ms) and 2.00 to 2.20 W under load (416
//! to 1690 ms), so the spans are real and timing by them reads as steadily as
//! on the M5 Max.
//!
//! Two more measured behaviors constrain the design:
//! - `GPU Energy` (nJ) is stamped at sample time on an M5 Max (0.1 to 0.4 ms
//!   old) and moves on every sample under load. At idle it reads exactly
//!   0 nJ per window, so a zero there is 0 W, not a missing publication. On
//!   an M1 Ultra it publishes every 109 to 139 ms, mostly within 1 ms of the
//!   sample, and an idle GPU also publishes whole windows of exactly 0 nJ
//!   (22 of 60 ticks in each recorded run), which are 0 W. A sample can land
//!   before the next publication, though: the idle run saw the stamp move
//!   only 6 to 12 ms with no energy, stamped 105 to 116 ms before the sample,
//!   and exploratory runs that sampled about every 200 ms with the GPU
//!   drawing about 8 W saw it not move at all. Neither is 0 W. The tracker
//!   tells them apart by the span, not the value: it holds the previous
//!   reading, and the next span (218 to 246 ms in the idle run) carries the
//!   energy of both.
//! - Publications split. A batch is sometimes followed 9 to 26 ms later by a
//!   small second publication with its own timestamp (`CPU Energy`: 4969 mJ
//!   over 2043.0 ms, then 65 mJ over 14.8 ms), and one channel can land a
//!   sample after the others (`DRAM0` once published 25 ms after
//!   `CPU Energy`, with its own 2158.5 ms span). A single "the roll-up moved"
//!   clock cannot time both, so timing is per channel. On an M1 Ultra the
//!   tails came 12 to 29 ms after the publication (445 mJ over 26.3 ms under
//!   load, folded into the next span).
//!
//! So power comes from the driver's own publication times. Each channel's
//! `RawElements` data holds xnu's `IOReportElement`
//! (`IOKernelReportStructs.h`): provider id at byte 0, channel id at 8,
//! channel type at 16, the `mach_absolute_time` of the driver's last update at
//! 24, and the value at 32. [`EnergyTracker`] keeps a `(value, timestamp)`
//! baseline per channel and, when a channel publishes, reports
//! `(value - baseline) / (timestamp - baseline timestamp)`. It holds the
//! previous reading while a channel has not published, folds publications
//! under 50 ms into the next span, and drops a reading after 10 s without
//! one, or after two of the channel's own spans when those are longer (a
//! headless M5 Ultra publishes its mJ channels every 30 min, so its readings
//! are half-hour averages). A channel whose elements carry no usable
//! timestamp is timed by when each sample was taken, which is the old
//! poll-window behavior.
//!
//! The timestamps have to be read from raw samples. In the output of
//! `IOReportCreateSamplesDelta` an element's timestamp is the older sample's,
//! so a delta cannot say when the energy it carries was published. Residency
//! and frequency still come from the delta: those counters advance on every
//! sample.
