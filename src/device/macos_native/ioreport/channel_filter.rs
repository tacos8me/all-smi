//! Which channels the IOReport subscription asks for.
//!
//! `IOReportCopyChannelsInGroup` describes every channel in a group, and a
//! subscription samples whatever it was opened with. On an M5 Max that is 364
//! Energy Model channels, of which five feed a rail, next to 18 CPU and one
//! GPU performance-state channel; an M1 Ultra has 321 and an M5 Ultra 725, of
//! which eight are kept. Each group's description is cut down to the channels
//! something reads before the groups are merged, using the same predicates the
//! parsers use, so nothing that was read before is dropped:
//!
//! | group | kept | predicate |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Energy Model` | 5 of 364 (M5 Max), 8 of 321 (M1 Ultra), 8 of 725 (M5 Ultra) | [`classify_energy_channel`] |
//! | `CPU Stats` / `CPU Core Performance States` | 18 of 18 | [`classify_cpu_channel`] |
//! | `GPU Stats` / `GPU Performance States` | 1 of 1 | `GPUPH` |
//!
//! Measured on an M5 Max in a release build at a 1 s poll, the merged
//! subscription drops from 383 to 24 channels, `IOReportCreateSamples` from
//! 10.2 ms to 8.7 ms, reading the energy channels out of a raw sample from
//! 226 us to 26 us, and the residency delta from 772 us to 238 us. The
//! sample call stays the floor: the providers do their work per sample, not
//! per channel.
