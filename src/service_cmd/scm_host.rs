//! The `all-smi service run` host: the process side of the Windows
//! service (issue #311).
//!
//! `service run` is hidden from `--help` because no operator should type
//! it. The Service Control Manager starts the registered binary with
//! these arguments and expects the process to call
//! `StartServiceCtrlDispatcher` promptly; run from a console the call
//! fails with `ERROR_FAILED_SERVICE_CONTROLLER_CONNECT` and this module
//! explains that rather than surfacing the raw error.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Install the rolling file subscriber, because stdout is void here.
//! 2. Register the control handler and report `SERVICE_START_PENDING`
//!    with a wait hint.
//! 3. Load the merged TOML + environment configuration and build the
//!    Tokio runtime.
//! 4. Report `SERVICE_RUNNING` once a listener is actually bound, not
//!    when the task is merely spawned.
//! 5. On Stop or Shutdown, report `SERVICE_STOP_PENDING`, raise the
//!    process-wide shutdown latch, and let `run_api_mode` drain the
//!    server and flush the energy WAL before reporting
//!    `SERVICE_STOPPED`.
//!
//! Step 5 is the reason the shutdown latch exists at all. Calling
//! `std::process::exit` from the control handler would strand the
//! pending Joule deltas and break Prometheus counter monotonicity across
//! a service restart.
